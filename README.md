# -E-Commerce-BaCk-ENd


 # Description  
 
 This project is about building the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application creates a database using mySQL with models and associations. API Routes are derived to perform RESTful CRUD operations using sequelized models and the same is being tested in Insomnia.
